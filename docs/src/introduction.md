# Introduction

**Par** is affectionatelly named after the most bemusing connective of
[linear logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_logic): ⅋, pronounced _"par"_.
That's because Par is based directly on (classical) linear logic, as an experiment to
see where this paradigm can take us.

[Jean-Yves Girard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Yves_Girard) — the author of linear logic,
and [System F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_F), among other things — wrote on the page 3
of his [first paper on linear logic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304397587900454):

> The new connectives of linear logic have obvious meanings in terms of
parallel computation, especially the multiplicatives.

This was in 1987. In hindsight, it wasn't that obvious. What's obvious is that it _is there_
— the parallel computation, that is. What isn't obvious at all is how to turn it into a practical
programming language.
